# kidCraft

A simple plug in to manage my kids time on Minecraft:
	My Kids want to play all the time and there is always some drama when it's time to stop.
	My Solution is a simple plug in with a web interface to give each child some time credit for good behaviour
	I've also added a custom teleport command to help them out (*tp in hte chat) and the possibility of giving them a small gift for their inventory if they've been really good

	To show up on the web interface, the player has to attempt loging into the server first.
