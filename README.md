# kidCraft

A simple plug in to manage my kids time on Minecraft via a web interface:

* My Kids want to play all the time and there is always some drama when it's time to stop.
* My Solution is a simple spigot plugin with a web interface to give each child some time credit for good behaviour (or to take some time away if there have been issues!)
* I've also added a custom teleport command to help them out (*tp in the chat) and the possibility of giving them a small gift for their inventory if they've been really good

* To show up on the web interface, the player has to attempt loging into the server first.
